/* 
This is also adapted from the version in the repository MIT-LCP, written by Alistair Johnson. We use a couple of amended tables here.

We are using forward filled values for the labs.

We change the boundary so that the start time is inclusive and the end time is exclusive instead, it feels more intuitive sense. 
As a result we have also changed from the endtime to starttime for checking vasopressors

We also modified the definition of the ventilation component slightly to include the case where a patient is on ventilation but has a PF of above 200.

The following is a description of SOFA by Alistair (with a couple of changes to the list of views).

-- Title: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
-- This query extracts the sequential organ failure assessment (formally: sepsis-related organ failure assessment).
-- This score is a measure of organ failure for patients in the ICU.
-- The score is calculated for every hour of the patient's ICU stay.
-- However, as the calculation window is 24 hours, care should be taken when
-- using the score before the end of the first day.
